**Author:** Reema Kusa  
**Date:** 2025-11-11

This project delivers **Exploratory** (Part I) and **Explanatory** (Part II) visualizations for the **Prosper Loans** dataset.
It satisfies the rubric requirements (7+ charts across univariate, bivariate, multivariate; polished explanatory visuals).

## Files
- `Part_I_exploratory_prosper.ipynb` – complete exploratory analysis with required plots:
  - Univariate: Histogram (required), Count Plot
  - Bivariate: Scatter (required), Box (required), Bar, Clustered Count/Bar, Heatmap
  - Multivariate: Facet (required), Pair Plot, Scatter with multiple encodings
- `Part_II_explanatory_prosper.ipynb` – polished visuals telling a clear story.
- `DATA_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` – where to place the dataset and expected filename.

## Dataset
Use the classic Udacity file: **`prosperLoanData.csv`** (not included here due to size).  
Place it next to the notebooks or in `./data/` as described in `DATA_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter / Udacity Workspace.
2. Ensure libraries are installed: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
3. Put `prosperLoanData.csv` next to the notebooks and **Run All**.

## Export
- From the notebook menu: **File → Download as → HTML (.html)** (or PDF).
- Submit your exported HTML/PDF files with the notebooks if requested.

## Rubric Mapping (Quick)
- **Exploratory (Part I):** Histogram, Scatter, Box, Facet, and additional charts. Clear labels, titles, legends, annotations.
- **Explanatory (Part II):** Context, overarching question, 3–5 polished visuals with commentary and conclusions.
